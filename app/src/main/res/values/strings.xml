Most English learners have the same problems.\n\nThis Readme will teach you the basic parts of the system that the <b>Hot English Magazine</b> application uses to train successful business leaders and government officials to speak English powerfully, confidently and successfully.\n\n\n<b>Why Are You Embarrassed By Your English Speaking?</b>\n\nWhy can\'t you speak English well yet? What is the problem? The problem is the school teaching system: textbooks, grammar study, vocabulary lists and translation.\nEnglish classes prepare you for tests but they do not teach you to speak quickly, easily, and automatically.\nThat\'s why, even after many years of study, you still have trouble speaking English.\n\n\n<b>Better Results Require A Better Learning Method.</b>\n\nTo get better results you must change the way you learn English.

    <string name="readme_intro_13">Use the rules and change the way you learn English.</string>

    <string name="readme_rule_1_1" formatted="false"><b>Rule 1: Learn phrases, not individual words!</b>\n\nDid you know that the failure rate for English schools is 95%. Only 5% of students who join an English school actually learn to speak easily and naturally.  Only 5%. That is a 95% failure rate.\n\nYou have probably spent a lot of time trying to memorize word lists. With <b>Hot English Magazine</b> you are not going to do that anymore. Why? Because <b>vocabulary lists are a waste of time</b>.\n\nYes, you heard me right! Trying to memorize individual words is not an effective way to learn. Instead, you\'re going to use the first rule of the <b>Hot English Magazine</b> method and <b>learn phrases, not words</b>.\n\n\n<b>Stop studying English words!</b>\n\nThat\'s right, do not memorize single words. Native speakers (ex. Americans) do not learn English by remembering single words. <b>Native speakers mostly learn phrases</b>.\n\nPhrases are GROUPS of words that naturally go together. In fact, when you learn phrases you learn both vocabulary and grammar&#8212; in a natural way.\n\n\n<b>Learn Vocabulary Faster</b>\n\nResearch by Dr. James Asher shows that learning phrases is 4 times faster than learning individual words.\n\nIn other words, when you learn phrases you learn new vocabulary faster.\n\nAlso, his research found that students who learn phrases have <b>better spoken grammar</b> (than students who learned single words).\n\n\n<b>Better Pronunciation</b>\n\nNative speakers (Americans, British,..) speak in phrases, not word by word.\n\nThe rhythm of English is created by the natural pattern of pauses. <b>Native speakers naturally pause between phrases.</b> They speak the language in phrases, in short pieces of English.\n\nBecause they learned English mostly from phrases, their pronunciation is clear and easy to understand.\n\nTo have <b>good pronunciation</b>, you too must learn to speak in phrases too.\n\n<b>Rule 1:  Always Study and Review Phrases, Not Individual Words</b>\n\nNever study a single, individual word. Never!\n\nWhen you find a new word, always write down the other words with it. Always! When you review, always review all of the phrase,.. not just the single word.\n\nAlways study natural GROUPS of words&#8212; phrases and sentences.\n\nWe guarantee this simple change will:</string>
    <string name="readme_rule_1_2">Improve your spoken grammar</string>
    <string name="readme_rule_1_3">Improve your vocabulary</string>
    <string name="readme_rule_1_4">Improve your pronunciation</string>

    <string name="readme_rule_2" formatted="false"><b>Rule 2: Don\'t study grammar!</b>\n\nThis is rule No. 2&#8212; and this is a big one! Are you surprised?\n\nRule 2 is a key part of the system that has helped business leaders, government officials, and <b>people like you</b> finally <b>speak English confidently in 6 months or less</b>!\n\nPut away your grammar books. <b>Grammar books are for children!</b> Grammar rules teach you to think about English, you want to speak automatically&#8212; without thinking!\n\nWith Effortless English, you learn English without grammar study. You speak English naturally. English speaking isn\'t a formula you memorize&#8212; it\'s a skill you must use instantly and effortlessly.\n\nSo, Rule No. 2 is <b>Don\'t Study Grammar!</b></string>
