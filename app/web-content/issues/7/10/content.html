			<h3>A television host. A cultural icon. A friend. A man named Fred Rogers <a class="new-word" data-word="to host" data-type="vb" data-en="if you “host” a television show, you introduce the show and talk to the people on it">hosted</a> the television show Mr Rogers’ Neighborhood for 33 seasons. In the United States, 20th March is National “Wear a Sweater Day” in honor of Mr Rogers. But why is he worthy of such an honor? And what does wearing a <a class="new-word" data-word="a sweater" data-type="n" data-en="a warm knitted piece of clothing which covers your arms and the upper part of your body">sweater</a> have to do with all of this?</h3>

			<p>Fred Rogers didn’t like television, which is why he decided to dedicate his life to it. “In fact,” he said, “I went into television because I hated it, and I thought there was some way of using this fabulous <a class="new-word" data-word="an instrument" data-type="n" data-en="a tool or device that is used to do a particular task">instrument</a> to <a class="new-word" data-word="to nurture" data-type="vb" data-en="to care for something while it is growing or developing">nurture</a> those who would watch and listen.” That was when he began to work for a local television station in Pittsburgh on a show called The Children’s Corner. On that show, he did the voices for several <a class="new-word" data-word="a puppet" data-type="n" data-en="a doll that you can move by either pulling strings or putting your hand inside its body and moving your fingers">puppets</a>. After working there, he developed a shorter version of the show Mr Rogers' Neighborhood. A longer version eventually aired on PBS in 1968, and stayed there for 33 seasons.</p>
			<p>Mr Rogers used his program <a class="new-word" data-word="to do good" data-type="exp" data-en="if you “do good”, you benefit or improve someone else’s life">to do good</a>. The messages he taught on the show were a reflection of his real-life beliefs. Mr Rogers' Neighborhood had a lot of valuable lessons for <a class="new-word" data-word="absorbent" data-type="adj" data-en="if minds are “absorbent”, they can learn new things easily">absorbent</a> minds. He taught children to believe in themselves, gave them self-confidence and told them they were special. Every afternoon, Mr Rogers invited children and adults alike into his living room. He took off his coat, and put on a sweater. He removed his <a class="new-word" data-word="dress shoes" data-type="n" data-en="shoes for working in a professional setting">dress shoes</a> and put on casual, blue <a class="new-word" data-word="boat shoes" data-type="n" data-en="shoes for working on a boat / ship">boat shoes</a>. He made himself comfortable. And by doing this simple act, he let people into his life, and made an impact on them at the same time. While changing clothes, he would say, “Would you be mine? Could you be mine? Won’t you be my neighbor?” And after 33 seasons, he helped <a class="new-word" data-word="to raise" data-type="vb" data-en="if you “raise” a child, you look after it until it is grown up">raise</a> a generation of Americans.</p>
			<p>Mr Rogers had unbelievable power over people. At the Daytime Emmys in 1997, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award. In his acceptance speech, he asked everyone in the audience to think about “those who cared about you and wanted what’s best for you. Take ten seconds. I’ll watch the time.” In a theatre filled with thousands of people, Fred Rogers managed to <a class="new-word" data-word="to silence" data-type="vb" data-en="if you “silence” someone, you stop them from speaking or making a noise">silence</a> the entire place. The cameras <a class="new-word" data-word="to pan" data-type="vb" data-en="if a television camera “pans” somewhere, it moves slowly across that area in a wide movement">panned</a> over the audience of <a class="new-word" data-word="tear-stained" data-type="adj" data-en="if your face is “tear-stained”, you have recently been crying a lot">tear-stained</a> faces, and then turned back to Mr Rogers. He then concluded, “Thank you for allowing me to be your neighbor all these years.” Another example of his positive influence came in 1990. That year, Mr Rogers’ car was stolen. He filed a police report and 48 hours later his car was mysteriously returned in the same spot. But that’s not all. Attached to the car was a note that said, “If we'd known that this was your car, we never would have taken it.” Now that’s power.</p>
			<p>Fred Rogers was an interesting man. He woke up at five o’clock every morning to go swimming. He weighed 143 pounds (65 kg) for 30 years. He began playing piano when he was five years old. He spoke French. He had an <a class="new-word" data-word="an asteroid" data-type="n" data-en="a rocky or metallic object that orbits the Sun but is too small to be considered a planet">asteroid</a> named after him in 2003. He is a <a class="new-word" data-word="timeless" data-type="adj" data-en="something so good that it is not affected by changes in society or fashion">timeless</a> figure, largely in part to his <a class="new-word" data-word="soothing" data-type="adj" data-en="calming; making pain or stress disappear">soothing</a> voice and the fact that he always explained things in terms all ages could understand.</p>
			<p>The word “celebrity” hardlycomes to mind when we think of Mr Rogers. This could be because there is usually a barrier between celebrities and “regular” people. But this wasn’t the case with Mr Rogers. He always made us feel like we had a friend. And on 20th March, Mr Rogers’ neighbors all over the United States put on their sweaters to show their thanks. <span class="accent">✪</span></p>

				<h4>Mr. Rogers Quotes</h4>
				<p>“How sad it is that we give up on people who are just like us.”</p>
				<p>“You know, you don’t have to look like everybody else to be acceptable and to feel acceptable.”</p>
				<p>“If you could only sense how important you are to the lives of those you meet; how important you can be to people you may never even dream of. There is something of yourself that you leave at every meeting with another person.”</p>
				<p>“It’s not the honors and the prizes or the <a class="new-word" data-word="fancy" data-type="adj" data-en="elaborate; special because it has a lot of decoration or too much">fancy</a> outsides of life that ultimately <a class="new-word" data-word="to nourish" data-type="vb" data-en="if you “nourish” a feeling, you encourage or allow it to grow">nourish</a> our souls. It’s the feeling that we can be trusted, that we never have to fear the truth, and that the <a class="new-word" data-word="the bedrock" data-type="n" data-en="the principles, ideas or facts on which something is based">bedrock</a> of our very being is firm.”</p>
				<p>“The greatest gift we can give to anybody is our honest self.”</p>
				<p>“Those of us who have a particular vision must continue against all odds.”</p>
				<p>“The whole idea is to look at the television camera and present as much love as you possibly could to a person who might feel that he or she needs it.”</p>
