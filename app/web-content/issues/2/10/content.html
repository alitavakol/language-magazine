			<p>The film Hunger is about the life and death of <a class="new-word" data-word="a republican" data-type="n" data-en="a person who wants a united Ireland with no rule by the UK in the north">republican</a> <a class="new-word" data-word="a hunger strike" data-type="n" data-en="a protest by prisoners that consists of not eating">hunger striker</a> Bobby Sands. The film was controversial because some considered Sands to be a terrorist as he was a member of the <a class="new-word" data-word="the IRA" data-type="abbr" data-en="the Irish Republican Army – an armed group that fought against British rule in northern Ireland">IRA</a>. However, others saw him as a hero who took part in a peaceful protest. The film was directed by Steve McQueen, a British director.</p>
			<div class="box">
				<h3>Bobby Sands</h3>
				<p>Robert Gerard Sands, also known as Bobby Sands, was born on 9th March 1954. He was a Provisional Irish Republican Army volunteer and a member of the UK Parliament. He died on 5th May 1981 after a hunger strike in prison.</p>
				<img src="bobby.png" style="width: 100%;">
			</div>
			<p>Speaking about the film, McQueen said that what Bobby Sands did wasn't right or wrong. "The film is about people’s decisions and the <a class="new-word" data-word="consequences" data-type="n" data-en="the results of an action or event">consequences</a> of those decisions,” he added.</p>
			<p>Actor Michael Fassbender (who was Stelios in the film 300), played the <a class="new-word" data-word="a role" data-type="n" data-en="a part in a film">role</a> of Sands. Fassbender was born in Germany but <a class="new-word" data-word="to be brought up" data-type="phr vb" data-en="the place where you are “brought up”, is the place where you live and are educated as a child">was brought up</a> in Ireland.</p>
			<p>Bobby Sands was 27 years old when he died. During the hunger strikes in the Maze Prison in 1981 he was elected as a member of the British Parliament. There were world-wide protests supporting him and other prisoners refused to eat too. Eventually, 10 protesters died while trying to get recognised as prisoners of war. Surprisingly, several <a class="new-word" data-word="Loyalists" data-type="n" data-en="Protestant paramilitaries who fought against the Republicans in Northern Ireland. They want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the UK">Loyalists</a> said that they also supported the Republicans’ protest. <span class="accent">✪</span></p>
