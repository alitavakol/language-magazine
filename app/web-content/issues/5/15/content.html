			<h4><span class="accent">❶</span> <b>Think about it</b></h4>
			<p style="margin-top: 0;">Which airlines are there in your country? Have you ever flown on them? What was it like? Are there any low-cost airlines? Where do they fly to? What are some of your favourite airlines? Are there any entrepreneurs from your country who have set up airlines? Who are they? How successful have they been?</p>

			<h4><span class="accent">❷</span> <b>Reading</b></h4>
			<p style="margin-top: 0;">Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou is a British entrepreneur of <a class="new-word" data-word="Greek-Cypriot" data-type="adj" data-en="a Greek person from the island of Cyprus. Greeks comprise about 75% of the population">Greek-Cypriot</a> origin. He’s famous for starting the <a class="new-word" data-word="a low-cost airline" data-type="n" data-en="an airline that offers cheap flights">low-cost airline</a> easyJet – the largest UK-based airline and Europe’s second biggest (after Ryanair). Here are some of his top tips for succeeding in the world of business.</p>
			<h4 class="accent">Look out for new ideas!</h4>
			<p style="margin-top: 0;">Stelios has launched several <a class="new-word" data-word="a venture" data-type="n" data-en="a project which is new and difficult">ventures</a> under the <a class="new-word" data-word="a holding company" data-type="n" data-en="a company that’s created to buy and hold the shares of other companies in a group">holding company</a> easyGroup and is constantly <a class="new-word" data-word="on the lookout for" data-type="exp" data-en="if you’re “on the lookout” for something, you’re trying to find that thing">on the lookout for</a> new ideas. “I travel and try to <a class="new-word" data-word="to keep your eyes and ears open" data-type="exp" data-en="to watch or listen carefully for something">keep my ears and eyes open</a> in order to identify new opportunities. Then I study the <a class="new-word" data-word="a business plan" data-type="n" data-en="a formal document with information on a business: goals, plans for reaching the future, financial details, team information…">business plan</a>, working on different <a class="new-word" data-word="a scenario" data-type="n" data-en="a situation">scenarios</a> to see what costs and <a class="new-word" data-word="revenue" data-type="n" data-en="money a company receives from sales, etc.">revenues</a> are possible,” he explained in an interview.</p>
			<h4 class="accent">Take risks!</h4>
			<p style="margin-top: 0;">“Each time I launch a business, I’m <a class="new-word" data-word="to risk" data-type="n" data-en="if you “risk” your money, you invest it in something that could fail and make you lose all your money">risking</a> my own money and the risk is that I will lose that money. There’s no <a class="new-word" data-word="a reward" data-type="n" data-en="profit, money you make, something you get">reward</a> without risk,” Stelios once said in an interview. However, he warns against taking unnecessary risks. “<a class="new-word" data-word="to crunch numbers" data-type="exp" data-en="if you “crunch numbers”, you analyse the numbers and work out how much you can spend, how much profit you can make, etc.">Crunch some numbers</a> and look at various scenarios – <a class="new-word" data-word="worst case (scenario)" data-type="exp" data-en="the worst possible situation">worst case</a> as well as <a class="new-word" data-word="best case (scenario)" data-type="exp" data-en="the best possible situation">best case</a>. Also, you may need an <a class="new-word" data-word="an exit strategy" data-type="n" data-en="a pre-planned way to leave the situation">exit strategy</a>, in case it all goes wrong. Get advice, speak to friends and associates, hope for luck, but at the end of the day only you can make your own decisions,” he added.</p>
			<h4 class="accent">Have clear brand values!</h4>
			<p style="margin-top: 0;">Since the establishment of easyJet in 1995, Stelios has set up 16 other companies as part of easyGroup. These include easyBus, easyCruise, easyOffice, easyCar, easyPizza, easyHotel and easyInternetcafe. However, although they offer different services, they all have the same distinctive orange logo, as well as offering a <a class="new-word" data-word="no-frills" data-type="adj" data-en="a “no-frills” service has no extras (such as free food, etc.) – just the very basic service">no-frills</a> service and using the <a class="new-word" data-word="the yield management system" data-type="exp" data-en="a system in which prices are changed according to demand">yield management system</a> to set prices. On top of that, they follow the easyGroup’s <a class="new-word" data-word="brand guidelines" data-type="n" data-en="information on how to present a product or service to the public: how to treat customers, how to communicate ideas, etc.">brand guidelines</a>, which include: offer great value, keep it simple, <a class="new-word" data-word="to innovate" data-type="vb" data-en="to introduce changes and new ways of doing things">innovate</a> <a class="new-word" data-word="relentlessly" data-type="adv" data-en="without stopping">relentlessly</a>, make a difference in people’s lives, and offer an honest, open and caring service.</p>
			<h4 class="accent">Listen!</h4>
			<p style="margin-top: 0;">Stelios thinks that it’s important to have people to look up to as <a class="new-word" data-word="a role model" data-type="n" data-en="a person you use as a positive example of how to do something">role models</a> or <a class="new-word" data-word="a mentor" data-type="n" data-en="an older, more experienced person who gives you help and advice">mentors</a>. “I have business heroes and people I admire. <a class="new-word" data-word="Richard Branson" data-type="n" data-en="an English businessman who is best known as the founder of Virgin Group">Richard Branson</a> was one of my early business heroes and he was one of the reasons I got into the airline business. At the beginning of the 90s, I was talking to him about becoming a <a class="new-word" data-word="a franchisee" data-type="n" data-en="a person who buys a particular franchise (a right to sell the products or services of another company)">franchisee</a> of Virgin Atlantic but in the end I decided to go it alone,” he explained.</p>
			<h4 class="accent">Enjoy it!</h4>
			<p style="margin-top: 0;">Finally, Stelios believes that it’s important to have fun while you’re running your business. “Many of the easyGroup businesses are a result of my turning a hobby or just something I was passionate about into a business. Look at easyCruise. As a Greek person born into a shipping family I wanted to apply the Easy brand to offering people great holidays at sea, like the ones I enjoyed, and still enjoy, as a kid at the Greek Islands or the South of France. It’s essential that you enjoy what you’re doing in order to motivate yourself,” he explains. Of course, running a business involves a lot more than just that. “Hard work really is one of the best tools to success. You remember Gary Player, the golfer, who said, ‘The harder I practise, the luckier I get’?” he added.</p>
