			<h4><span class="accent">❶</span> <b>Think about it</b></h4>
			<p>When was the last time you felt like getting your revenge? Why did you want to get your revenge? Have you ever been angry with a bank, hotel, airline, travel agency or restaurant? Why? What happened? What are the pros and cons of getting your revenge? What films about revenge have you seen? What's the storyline?</p>

			<h4><span class="accent">❷</span> <b>Pre reading</b></h4>
			<p>Look at these titles. What do you think happened to these people to make them so angry? How do you think they got their revenge?</p>

				<p style="padding-top: 0;"><span data-start="" data-end="">What comes to mind when you think of Britain? Buckingham Palace, a pint of beer, a double-decker bus, horse racing, fish and chips, cricket&#8230; What about British people? The Guardian newspaper asked foreigners living in the UK for their opinions on the British. Here are some of their answers.[Please note: as the speakers are non-natives, there are some examples of non-Standard English.]</span></p>
				<p>“The strangest&#8230; well for me, can I say food? Like, for example, that you eat on the <a class="new-word" data-word="a couch" data-type="n" data-en="a sofa; a long, soft chair that two or three people can sit on">couch</a> not on a table.” (Irene, 23, a small business owner from Italy)</p>
				<p>“When a British person has a problem with another person they don’t actually come and tell that person directly in their face.” (Felicia, 37, an <a class="new-word" data-word="obstetrics" data-type="n" data-en="the branch of medicine that is concerned with pregnancy and giving birth">obstetrics</a> and <a class="new-word" data-word="gynaecology" data-type="n" data-en="the branch of medicine which deals with women's diseases and conditions">gynaecology</a> consultant from Romania)</p>
				<p>“Here, if you’ve done something really good, they will say ‘This is not bad.’” (Spela, 41, a graphic designer from Slovenia)</p>
				<p>“I find it strange that British people are so much <a class="new-word" data-word="into" data-type="exp" data-en="if you’re “into” something, you like it">into</a> beer and, you know, not into wine. But that’s just me!” (Valeria, 32, a journalist from France)</p>
				<p>“I find it strange seeing that they still accept this so-called ‘<a class="new-word" data-word="the class system" data-type="n" data-en="the way that society is divided into different classes: working class, middle class, etc.">class system</a>’, you know, in education, you know, in the modern world.” (Dick, 75, a retired oil executive from the Netherlands)</p>
				<p>“I really don’t know, just drinking tea with milk but I had it myself and it’s OK.” (Janis, 25, a cook and psychology student from Latvia) </p>
				<p>“Here in England I see so many people and it’s 3 degrees Celsius, and they have <a class="new-word" data-word="short sleeves" data-type="n" data-en="if someone is in “short sleeves”, they’re wearing a T-shirt or a shirt with no “sleeves” (the part of the shirt that covers your arms)">short sleeves</a> and I don’t understand it. <a class="new-word" data-word="fingers crossed" data-type="exp" data-en="when people say “fingers crossed”, they mean “good luck”">Fingers crossed</a> to them, they are heroes for me.” (Jakub, 36, a wine waiter from the Czech Republic) </p>
				<p>“The strangest thing about British people is probably lunchtime <a class="new-word" data-word="a pint" data-type="n" data-en="a measurement of liquid that’s about half a litre (500 ml)">pints</a>. It always shocks me to go from a meeting to the bar to have a pint, back to the meeting&#8230;” (Hector, 26, an entrepreneur from Cyprus) </p>
				<p>“The mixes they do with food, I would never understand why in a very English pub there’s a Thai restaurant&#8230; why? Why do they put <a class="new-word" data-word="sweet corn" data-type="n" data-en="a long vegetable covered in small yellow seeds. The seeds can also be referred to as sweet corn">sweet corn</a> in tuna&#8230; why?” (Helena, 27, a businessperson from Spain)</p>
				<p>“People are very fond of <a class="new-word" data-word="to queue" data-type="vb" data-en="if you “queue”, you wait in a line so you can be served in a shop, etc.">queuing</a>, that’s a <a class="new-word" data-word="a stereotype" data-type="n" data-en="a very general and typical image of someone or a group of people">stereotype</a> but it’s true. I think I’ve <a class="new-word" data-word="to get into the spirit" data-type="exp" data-en="if you “get into the spirit” of something, you start doing the same things as everyone else (in this case, queuing)">gotten into the spirit</a> as well, so whenever I am in another country and people don’t queue I get very angry, so I think I am slowly becoming more British.” (Philipp, 23, a law student from Austria)</p>
