				<h1><span style="font-weight: 300; font-style: italic;">Richard Simmons:</span><br>Never Say Diet.</h1>
				<h5>Have you ever been on a diet? If you are looking to get in shape, perhaps you should try the Richard Simmons method. Diet <a class="new-word" style="font-weight: bold; color: yellow" data-word="a guru" data-type="n" data-en="an expert or leader">guru</a> and self-made millionaire, Richard Simmons helps people slim down. As a child, Simmons had his own weight problems. Now he lives to help others lose weight and feel great.</h5>
			</div>

			<p>Richard Simmons spent most of his childhood being overweight. By the time he was 18, he weighed more than 130 kilos. On a television interview, Simmons talked about a life-changing experience, “I went inside a store, came back to my car and saw a note. The note said, ‘You are killing yourself living like this. Please don’t die.’” Simmons, who afterwards lost 55 kilos, admits that he lost the weight in unhealthy ways. For the future, he wanted to provide desperate dieters with healthier methods.</p>
			<p>So, in an effort to present alternative weight loss options, Simmons made a <a class="new-word" data-word="fitness" data-type="n" data-en="if you have a good level of “fitness”, you are physically strong">fitness</a> videotape series  called “<a class="new-word" data-word="to sweat" data-type="vb" data-en="when you “sweat”, a salty colourless liquid comes out of your skin. This happens usually when you are hot, afraid or ill">Sweatin</a>’ to the Oldies.” In these workout videos, he wanted “real music”, not techno. On the tapes, he leads <a class="new-word" data-word="an exercise routine" data-type="n" data-en="a series of exercises you do to get fit and healthy">exercise routines</a>, and has a band behind him singing dance classics <img src="work.png" class="frame" style="float: right; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 8px; width: 50%; max-width: 5cm;"> from the 1950s and 1960s. His tapes have sold over 20 million copies. And, more than 20 years later, people still buy them. A satisfied customer says, “He shows you the meaning of ‘<a class="new-word" data-word="never give up" data-type="exp" data-en="never stop, even if it is difficult">never give up</a>’, and because of Richard Simmons, I feel so much better about myself.” Richard Simmons is a man who believes in his products, and who is appreciated by his public.</p>
			<p>Practising what he preaches, Richard took his fitness ideology all the way to Washington, DC. In 2006, he worked on a <a class="new-word" data-word="a legislative bill" data-type="n" data-en="a piece of paper that someone proposes to become a law">legislative bill</a> that proposed <a class="new-word" data-word="mandatory" data-type="adj" data-en="obligatory, something you must do">mandatory</a> physical education requirements in American public schools. During this time, he used his personal website as a discussion <a class="new-word" data-word="a forum" data-type="n" data-en="a place, situation or group where people can exchange ideas and talk about issues">forum</a> to “Ask America” for help. The bill said that severe weight gain in children can cause depression and diabetes, and that children need at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. Simmons gained the attention and support of millions of people.</p>
			<p>Aside from his political <a class="new-word" data-word="activism" data-type="n" data-en="the process of working for political change">activism</a>, 60-year-old Richard continues working hard. In addition to television appearances, interviews and marketing his fitness products, he has a weekly radio show called Lighten up with Richard Simmons. Also, he hosted his 3rd fitness <a class="new-word" data-word="a retreat" data-type="n" data-en="a quiet place you go to rest or to get away from stress">retreat</a> in Beverly Hills at his “<a class="new-word" data-word="a safe haven" data-type="exp" data-en="a place where you can be free from danger, stress, etc.">safe haven</a>” workout facility “Slimmons”. His retreat <a class="new-word" data-word="an itinerary" data-type="n" data-en="a plan of activities for an event or trip">itinerary</a> contains aerobic classes, nutrition <a class="new-word" data-word="a seminar" data-type="n" data-en="a meeting during which people hear about, discuss or learn about a topic">seminars</a> and naturally, sweating to some great music. He will do another one next year, as they are now an annual tradition.</p>
			<p>Richard Simmons will always be the <a class="new-word" data-word="a pioneer" data-type="n" data-en="the first person to  develop an idea or activity">pioneer</a> of fitness plans. But apart from that, he is a caring and charitable being with a deep devotion to help other people. He shows his passion in all of his products and <a class="new-word" data-word="to add a personal touch" data-type="exp" data-en="if you “add a personal touch” to something, you do something that shows it is yours">adds a personal touch</a> to everything he does. <span class="accent">✪</span></p>
