			<h1>Dumb Down</h1>
			<img src="cover.png">
			<h4 style="font-weight: 300;">This month we’re looking at the phrasal verb “to dumb down”. Basically, if you “dumb something down” you <a class="new-word" data-word="deliberately" data-type="adv" data-en="consciously and intentionally; on purpose" data-fa="از قصد، مخصوصاً">deliberately</a> simplify it so that others can understand it more easily.</h4>

			<p>The main problem with this expression is that it has some very negative <a class="new-word" data-word="a connotation" data-type="n" data-en="an idea or quality that a word makes you think about in addition to its meaning" data-fa="معنای ضمنی">connotations</a>. The word “dumb” can be used to mean “stupid”. For example:</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li><span>Sometimes he can be so dumb.</span></li>
				<li><span>I’m not dumb, you know!</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The word is also used in the <a class="new-word" data-word="to insult" data-type="vb" data-en="speak to or treat with disrespect" data-fa="توهین کردن">insulting</a> term “a dumb blonde”. This is used to refer to an attractive but supposedly “stupid” blonde woman, with all the resulting <a class="new-word" data-word="sexist" data-type="adj " data-en="that is insulting to women">sexist</a> jokes known as “dumb blonde jokes”. “Dumb” is also an old-fashioned and very <a class="new-word" data-word="a non-pc way" data-type="exp" data-en="a way that is insulting to some. “PC” is an abbreviation of “politically correct”">non-pc way</a> of referring to someone who is not able to talk. These days, people with an inability to speak are now known as “speech-impaired”;  and the person is known as a “speech-impaired person” or “person suffering from speech-impairment”.</p>
			<p>However, “dumbing  down” is a fairly common practice these days, particularly in the <a class="new-word" data-word="the mass media" data-type="n" data-en="the large news channels, newpapers, magazines etc.">mass media</a>. Some think it’s a good idea, others don’t like it. Television channels are often <a class="new-word" data-word="accused" data-type="adj" data-en="a person who is charged with or on trial for a crime" data-fa="متّهم">accused</a> of “dumbing down” their content in order to <a class="new-word" data-word="to appeal" data-type="vb" data-en="to ask" data-fa="جذب کردن">appeal</a> to a wider audience. <a class="new-word" data-word="a critic" data-type="n" data-en="a person who judges works, especially one who does so professionally" data-fa="منتقد">Critics</a> of this argue that there are more and more meaningless game shows and trivial programmes. Some channels are also accused  of “dumbing down” news reports. This is because media owners want to communicate with the masses.</p> 
			<p>The education system has also been accused of dumbing down certain qualifications. The terms “<a class="new-word" data-word="Mickey Mouse" data-type="adj" data-en="a “Mickey Mouse” exam is one that is too easy to be taken seriously">Mickey Mouse</a> Degrees” or “Mickey Mouse exams” are often used to describe courses or exams that people think are too easy, especially compared to exams of the past. Educational ministers argue that they are making courses and exams more practical and less theoretical.</p> 
			<h4 style="text-transform: none;">The expression in action</h4>
			<p>Here are some examples of this month’s expression.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span>They were accused of dumbing down their content in order to appeal to a wider audience.</span></li>
				<li><span>That’s too complicated for me. Could you dumb it down, please?</span></li>
				<li><span>We’re worried about the dumbing down of America.</span></li>
				<li><span>The BBC has denied it is dumbing down after buying the format for a Japanese game show where <a class="new-word" data-word="a contestant" data-type="n" data-en="a person who takes part in a contest or competition" data-fa="شرکت‌کننده در مسابقه">contestants</a> are <a class="new-word" data-word="to humiliate" data-type="vb" data-en="make (someone) feel ashamed" data-fa="خجالت‌زده کردن کسی">humiliated</a> through a string of tasks.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>And here are some examples of the expression in song lyrics.</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li><span>“They told me I should come down cousin, but I <a class="new-word" data-word="flatly" data-type="adv" data-en="absolutely" data-fa="صراحتاً">flatly</a> refuse, I ain’t dumb down nothing.” By the American rapper Lupe Fiasco on his song “Dumb It Down”.</span></li>
				<li><span>“I dumb down for my audience and double my dollars / they criticize me for it; but they all <a class="new-word" data-word="to yell" data-type="vb" data-en="shout in a loud, sharp way" data-fa="فریاد زدن">yell</a> ‘holla!’” By American rapper Jay-Z on the song “Moment of Clarity”. <span class="accent">✪</span></span></li>
