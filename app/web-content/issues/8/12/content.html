				<h3>Should the police<br>wear body-cameras?</h3>
			</div>

			<h4><span class="accent">❶</span> <b>Think about it</b></h4>
			<p>Have there been any stories about the police in the news in your country lately? What were they about? What level of trust do the police have in your country? How honest are they in general? How are they monitored? What equipment do the police use in your country? Do they ever wear body cameras? Why? Why not?  What do you think of body-cameras for police officers?</p>

			<h4><span class="accent">❷</span> <b>Pre-reading</b></h4>
			<p>You’re going to read an article about body cameras (body-cams) for the police. What are the pros and cons of the police wearing body-cams? Make notes.</p>

			<h4><span class="accent">❸</span> <b>Listening</b></h4>
			<p id="comments">Listen to the article many times. Were any of your ideas from the pre-reading activity mentioned?</p>
