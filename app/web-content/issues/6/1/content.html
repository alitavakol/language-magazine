			<h1 class="accent" style="text-transform: uppercase;">Don Arden</h1>
			<h4 style="font-weight: 300;">The music industry is a hard place to do business. Music managers, promoters and the people behind the scenes are known for their <a class="new-word" data-word="ruthlessness" data-type="n " data-en="if you act with “ruthlessness”, you have no pity or sympathy for others">ruthlessness</a>. One of the worst in the history of british music was Don Arden, <a class="new-word" data-word="AKA" data-type="acronym" data-en="Also Known As">aka</a> “the al capone of pop”.</h4>

			<p>Born as Harry Levy in 1926, Arden went into <a class="new-word" data-word="showbiz" data-type="abb inform" data-en="show business">showbiz</a> at the age of 13. He did <a class="new-word" data-word="a stand-up comedy" data-type="n" data-en="a comedy performance that consists of a single comedian talking to the audience">stand-up comedy</a> and singing during the war years. Don Arden was Jewish and he began his career in management by organising Hebrew folk music competitions. By the 1960s, he had moved into <a class="new-word" data-word="full-blown" data-type="adj" data-en="total; complete">full-blown</a> management and was organising British tours for American performers such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley.</p>
			<p>His first major group was The Small Faces. The group liked his enthusiasm and, in a short time, were <a class="new-word" data-word="to sign up" data-type="phr vb" data-en="to enlist / recruit someone to a company">signed up</a>. They had a chart <a class="new-word" data-word="a hit" data-type="n" data-en="something that is commercially successful">hit</a> but it entered the charts illegally – supposedly by <a class="new-word" data-word="to fix" data-type="vb" data-en="to organise / manipulate a result">fixing</a> it. But his <a class="new-word" data-word="foul play" data-type="exp" data-en="unlawful behaviour; illegal activities">foul play</a> with The Small Faces wasn’t over yet. In 1966, Robert Stigwood, another music manager spoke to The Small Faces about changing managers. Arden went to “teach him a lesson” with some friends and threatened to throw Stigwood out a window.</p> 
			<p>He also tried to strangle one of the musicians and throw him out  of a window.In the 1970s, Don Arden became manager of rock legends Black Sabbath and ELO. Arden’s problems really began to grow. In 1979, Arden had Sabbath’s singer Ozzy Osbourne thrown out of the band for drink and drug problems. <img src="w.jpg" class="frame" style="width: 40%; max-width: 3cm; float: right; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 8px;"> Arden’s daughter, Sharon, began to date and manage Ozzy. In an attempt to split them up, Arden told Ozzy that Sharon had tried to <a class="new-word" data-word="to seduce" data-type="vb" data-en="to persuade someone to do something, often by charming them">seduce</a> him, her own father. After this failed, Arden <a class="new-word" data-word="to set loose" data-type="phr vb" data-en="to release; to free (caged animals, etc)">set loose</a> his dogs on Sharon, who was pregnant. She had a <a class="new-word" data-word="a miscarriage" data-type="vb" data-en="the death of a baby during pregnancy">miscarriage</a> and didn’t speak to her father for over 20 years until Ozzy <a class="new-word" data-word="to reconcile" data-type="vb" data-en="to make friends again after an argument">reconciled</a> the two.</p> 
			<p>In the 1980s, Arden had a record company, but it collapsed after legal costs destroyed it. His son, David, seems to have <a class="new-word" data-word="to take a leaf from someone’s book" data-type="exp" data-en="to do things in a similar way to another person">taken a leaf</a> from his father’s book and went to prison for assaulting an employee. Don was also charged <a class="new-word" data-word="in relation with" data-type="exp" data-en="connected to">in relation with</a> this. Don Arden’s violent temper and unethical business practices eventually destroyed his business.</p>
			<p>His daughter’s business practices are somewhat different. Sharon is more open and is “<a class="new-word" data-word="flying high" data-type="exp" data-en="doing well">Flying High</a> Again” to quote one of her husband’s songs. She has been involved in court cases involving <a class="new-word" data-word="royalties" data-type="n" data-en="money earned from music sales">royalties</a> but, in general her methods are <a class="new-word" data-word="fairly" data-type="adv" data-en="quite">fairly</a> honest. She once said that her father taught her how to destroy a business and that was the best thing he ever did for her. If you want to succeed in business, you shouldn’t alienate too many people. Negative actions have a way of coming back to you. And in the case of Don Arden, losing his family and business are good examples of the saying, “<a class="new-word" data-word="what goes around, comes around" data-type="exp" data-en="what you do to others will be done to you; if you make others suffer, you will suffer too, one day">What goes around, comes around</a>”. <span class="accent">✪</span></p>
