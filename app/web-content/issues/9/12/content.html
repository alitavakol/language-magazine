				<p style="margin-top: 0;">Pierre Omidyar is the founder of the <a class="new-word" data-word="an online retailer" data-type="n" data-en="a website where you can buy or sell things">online retailer</a> <a class="new-word" data-word="eBay" data-type="n" data-en="a website where you can buy and sell things or put things up for “auction”">eBay</a>. With sales of around $20 billion per year and more than 200 million registered users, eBay processes more <a class="new-word" data-word="a transaction" data-type="n" data-en="an act of buying or selling something">transactions</a> than any other company in the world. Here are five important tips that took Pierre to the top.</p>
				<h4 class="accent-dark">⓵ Follow your passion</h4>
				<p>Pierre puts passion first. “Like most software people, it’s very much passion more than anything else – the ability to create software that could benefit or have an impact on people that used it was what was <a class="new-word" data-word="to drive" data-type="vb" data-en="the things that “drive” you are the things that motivate you or make you want to act">driving</a> me,” he says. If you love what you do, you’ll never do a day's work, so the saying goes.</p>
				<h4 class="accent-dark">⓶ Believe in the power of the individual</h4>
				<p>Pierre believes that it’s important to “recognise and respect everyone as a <a class="new-word" data-word="unique" data-type="adj" data-en="a “unique” person is special and different">unique</a> individual”. In creating his online <a class="new-word" data-word="an auction" data-type="n" data-en="a public sale in which goods are sold to the person who offers the highest price">auction</a> empire in 1993, Pierre wanted to <a class="new-word" data-word="to empower" data-type="vb" data-en="if you “empower” someone, you give them things so they can become stronger or more successful">empower</a> individuals. So, he provided a <a class="new-word" data-word="a feedback forum" data-type="n" data-en="a place where people can give opinions or feedback (criticism) and discuss things">feedback forum</a> where both buyers and sellers could <a class="new-word" data-word="to exchange tips" data-type="exp" data-en="if people “exchange tips”, they offer “tips” (useful pieces of advice or information)">exchange tips</a>, solve problems and <a class="new-word" data-word="to rate" data-type="vb" data-en="if you “rate” something, you say how good (or bad) you think it is">rate</a> their purchasing experiences.</p>
				<h4 class="accent-dark">⓷ Treat your customers</h4>
				<p>with the respect they deserveeBay’s rapid <a class="new-word" data-word="expansion" data-type="n" data-en="if a company is going through a period of “expansion”, it’s growing or becoming bigger">expansion</a> didn’t come without its problems. But it’s how these problems are managed that shows a company’s true character and strength. In 1999, the site experienced numerous service <a class="new-word" data-word="a disruption" data-type="n" data-en="when there’s “disruption”, there are problems and things don’t work or operate in a normal way">disruptions</a>, one lasting 22 hours. Pierre reacted quickly and responsibily by getting his team to make 10,000 phone calls to the top customers to <a class="new-word" data-word="to apologise" data-type="vb" data-en="to say sorry to someone">apologise</a> for the <a class="new-word" data-word="an inconvenience" data-type="n" data-en="a problem or difficulty">inconvenience</a>. He assured them that eBay was doing everything possible to deal with the problem.</p>
				<h4 class="accent-dark">⓸ Understand human nature</h4>
				<p>Pierre thinks that there’s a natural <a class="new-word" data-word="a trader" data-type="n" data-en="a person who buys or sells things">trader</a> in everyone. He understands that people love to buy things, and that many have a “<a class="new-word" data-word="one man’s junk is another man’s treasure" data-type="exp" data-en="this expression means: the thing that one person thinks is “junk” (rubbish), another person thinks is “treasure” (valuable)">one man’s junk is another man’s treasure</a>” philosophy. And this is the key to the success of eBay, where you can sell just about anything from broken <a class="new-word" data-word="trainers" data-type="n" data-en="shoes you wear to do sport">trainers</a> to <a class="new-word" data-word="rusty" data-type="adj" data-en="if a metal object is “rusty”, it has a brown substance on it that forms when it comes into contact with water">rusty</a> spanners to <a class="new-word" data-word="scratched" data-type="adj" data-en="if a record (for example) is “scratched”, it has a cut on it">scratched</a> records. “Fundamentally, everything we do in human activities is related to <a class="new-word" data-word="to trade" data-type="vb" data-en="to buy and sell things">trade</a>,” Pierre once said. There’s no better way to succeed in business than having good <a class="new-word" data-word="an insight" data-type="n" data-en="a good understanding of something">insight</a> into human behaviour.</p>
				<h4 class="accent-dark">⓹ Prepare for the unexpected</h4>
				<p>In an often repeated story, Pierre originally set up an online auction site just to help his wife sell and collect <a class="new-word" data-word="a Pez candy dispenser" data-type="exp" data-en="Pez is the brand name of a type of rectangular sweet. The sweets come in a “dispenser” (a machine that gives you something when you press a button, etc.)">Pez candy dispensers</a>. Although he admitted in an interview with the Academy of Achievement that the story had been invented, he still advises potential entrepreneurs to “prepare  for the unexpected”. “You’ll know you’re successful when the platform you’ve built serves you in unexpected ways,” he added. <span class="accent">✻</span></p>
