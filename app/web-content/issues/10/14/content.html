De Palma, whose movies aren’t for the <a class="new-word" data-word="faint hearted" data-type="adj" data-en="easily upset; weak; not strong">faint hearted</a>, was the target of the <a class="new-word" data-word="the American Right" data-type="n" data-en="politically conservative people in the USA">American Right</a> and television presenters such as Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. So, what was all the <a class="new-word" data-word="a fuss" data-type="n" data-en="trouble; problems; debate">fuss</a> about?</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="pey">
				<p>Brian de Palma’s best-known film is <i>Scarface</i>. <img src="scarface.jpg" class="frame" style="float: right; width: 50%; max-width: 5cm; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 8px;"> The film stars Al Pacino as a <a class="new-word" data-word="deranged" data-type="adj" data-en="violently insane; crazy and dangerous">deranged</a> gangster. This film is extremely <a class="new-word" data-word="violent" data-type="adj" data-en="using or involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something">violent</a> and, in general, Brian de Palma’s films have the <a class="new-word" data-word="a recurring theme" data-type="n" data-en="a concept or idea that you see repeatedly">recurring themes</a> of violence and <a class="new-word" data-word="the dark side" data-type="n" data-en="the ideas or part of humanity that is negative/evil/violent, etc">the dark side</a> of humanity. Brian de Palma got into trouble in the 1980s with feminists because of his film <i>Dressed to Kill</i>, and he has also been <a class="new-word" data-word="to brand" data-type="vb" data-en="to call someone a name or accuse them officially/publicly of being something">branded</a> a <a class="new-word" data-word="traitor" data-type="n" data-en="a person who betrays a friend, country, principle, etc." data-fa="خائن">traitor</a> for his Vietnam War film <i>Casualties of War</i>. <i>Redacted</i> has similar <a class="new-word" data-word="the subject matter" data-type="n" data-en="what something (a film, book, speech etc) is about">subject matter</a> to <i>Casualties of War</i> <img src="war.jpg" class="frame" style="float: left; width: 40%; max-width: 4cm; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-right: 8px; clear: both;"> but the reaction to the movie was much stronger. For example, the sole purpose of the website, BoycottRedacted.com was to attack the film. As a result, the film didn’t do well at the <a class="new-word" data-word="the box office" data-type="n" data-en="the front of a cinema where you pay for admission; if a film makes a lot at the “box office”, a lot of people see it at the cinema">box office</a>. In fact, when it was released in American cinemas in 2007, only 15 places showed it.</p>
				<p>The storyline is based on the <a class="new-word" data-word="to rape" data-type="vb" data-en="to force another person to have sexual intercourse with the offender against their will" data-fa="تجاوز به ناموس کردن">rape</a> and murder of a 14-year-old Iraqi girl by American soldiers in 2006. The soldiers then murdered her younger sister and parents. In the film, there is a lot of violence, including the <a class="new-word" data-word="to behead" data-type="vb" data-en="to cut off the head of someone">beheading</a> of a soldier by <a class="new-word" data-word="a militant" data-type="n" data-en="a combative and aggressive person in support of a political cause, who uses extreme, violent, or confrontational methods" data-fa="ستیزه‌جو، جنگ‌طلب">militants</a>, and roadside bombs. This film is not for the faint hearted. Everything in the film was based on fact. But what had changed? Americans didn’t want to see this film. <i>Casualties of War</i> had the same theme: a young Vietnamese girl is raped and murdered by American soldiers, but that film was quite successful. So, what was the difference? Some think that the problem was the <a class="new-word" data-word="the timing" data-type="n" data-en="the moment when something happens">timing</a> of the film given that the war in Iraq was still <a class="new-word" data-word="to go on" data-type="phr vb" data-en="to continue">going on</a>. <i>Casualties of War</i> was released in 1989, about 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War. But it seems that people don’t want to see a film about a war that’s actually going on. But that was the point of the movie, according to De Palma. Especially as the <a class="new-word" data-word="corporate media" data-type="n" data-en="the section of the newspapers, news channels etc that are controlled by large businesses">corporate media</a> refused to show the true picture. <img src="man.jpg" class="frame" style="float: right; width: 30%; max-width: 3cm; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 8px;"> The word “redacted” itself means “changed” or “edited” so that it is suitable for release.</p>
				<p>The main theme of the film is the same as many other war films: war is pointless, it is <a class="new-word" data-word="brutal" data-type="adj" data-en="extremely violent" data-fa="بی‌رحم، وحشی">brutal</a> and it solves nothing. The soldiers themselves are poor and are manipulated by politicians. But people didn’t want to hear about that. Other films about Iraq have also <a class="new-word" data-word="to flop" data-type="vb inform" data-en="to fail or do badly">flopped</a> at the box office and the only relatively successful movie similar to it, <i>The Kingdom</i>, was successful because it was an action movie. Despite its <a class="new-word" data-word="dismal" data-type="adj" data-en="really, really bad">dismal</a> performance in the cinema, Brian De Palma did win a <a class="new-word" data-word="prestigious" data-type="n" data-en="very important, elite; desired by a lot of people">prestigious</a> award for the film at the Venice Film Festival, the Silver Lion Award for Best Director.</p>
				<p>It seems that many people don’t want to see true images of war, especially if it’s a war that’s still going on. This, according to De Palma, is the <a class="new-word" data-word="a paradox" data-type="n" data-en="something that seems to contradict logic">paradox</a>. <span class="accent">✪</span></p>
