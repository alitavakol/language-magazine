			<h4 style="font-weight: 300;">This month we’re looking at the word “sleaze”.</h4>

			<p>“Sleaze” is often used to describe corruption and scandals in a government. Basically, anything involving sex, drugs, <a class="new-word" data-word="a backhander" data-type="n" data-en="money given to a government in return for a favour">backhanders</a> or <a class="new-word" data-word="cronyism" data-type="n" data-en="giving jobs and preference to your friends or people who pay you a sum of money">cronyism</a> would be described as sleaze if it involves members of government or <a class="new-word" data-word="high-ranking" data-type="adj" data-en="with a very important job">high-ranking</a> politicians. It is used widely by the <a class="new-word" data-word="a tabloid" data-type="n" data-en="a newspaper having pages half the size of those of the average broadsheet">tabloid</a> <a class="new-word" data-word="the press" data-type="n" data-en="newspapers, magazines, etc">press</a> to <a class="new-word" data-word="to sensationalise" data-type="vb" data-en="to make something seem more important or scandalous than it really is">sensationalise</a> news stories or events surrounding <a class="new-word" data-word="high-profile" data-type="adj" data-en="well known/famous/important">high profile</a> members of public life.</p>
			<p>The original sensationalised sleaze story in the British press was the Profumo Affair in the 1960s. A member of the <a class="new-word" data-word="Tory" data-type="n" data-en="a member of the British Conservative Party (a right-wing, traditional party)">Tory</a> government, John Profumo had an <a class="new-word" data-word="an affair" data-type="n" data-en="a romantic relationship with someone who isn’t your husband/wife">affair</a> with a <a class="new-word" data-word="a showgirl" data-type="n" data-en="a dancer in an erotic club">showgirl</a> called Christine Keeler. Events were made worse when it was reported that Keeler was also sleeping with a Soviet agent thereby <a class="new-word" data-word="to breach national security" data-type="exp" data-en="to endanger/break the security of a country">breaching national security</a> of the UK. Christine Keeler became even more famous a few weeks later when she posed for some semi-erotic photos. A Hollywood film <i>Scandal</i> was made about the affair starring Joanne Whalley. Another <a class="new-word" data-word="infamous" data-type="n" data-en="famous for negative reasons">infamous</a> example of sleaze involved another Tory <a class="new-word" data-word="an MP" data-type="abbr" data-en="a Member of the British parliament">MP</a>, Neil Hamilton. He was involved in the Cash for Questions <a class="new-word" data-word="a scandal" data-type="n" data-en="an action or event regarded as morally or legally wrong and causing general public outrage" data-fa="رسوایی، ننگ">scandal</a>. This was when Hamilton and another MP supposedly accepted <a class="new-word" data-word="a bribe" data-type="n" data-en="a sum of money given to an official in return for a favour">bribes</a> from the owner of <a class="new-word" data-word="Harrod’s" data-type="n" data-en="a large department store in London">Harrod’s</a>, Mohammed al Fayed, to ask questions for him in parliament. Hamilton’s political career was ruined but he later became a television personality because of it. </p>
			<p>One of the most infamous political scandals involved ex-president of the United States Bill Clinton when he had affairs with several White House interns. The best known of these was a girl called Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was <a class="new-word" data-word="to impeach" data-type="vb" data-en="to prosecute an American president in a trial for doing something illegal">impeached</a> for lying about the affair. His wife, Hillary, punished him by making him sleep on the sofa for a while. <span class="accent">✪</span></p>
