				<h4>Illuminati &amp; the one-dollar bill</h4>
				<p>An Illuminati symbol appears on the American dollar bill, with the “all-seeing eye” in a pyramid. The symbol is supposed to represent providence (destiny). The Latin phrase “novus ordo seclorum” also appears on the bill. It translates as “new order of the Ages” but some say it means “new World order”.</p>
