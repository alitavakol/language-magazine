			<h4 style="margin-top: 0;"><span class="accent">❶</span> <b>Think about it</b></h4>
			<p>Think of as many reasons as you can for giving someone a hug. For example: They’ve just won a competition, they’ve just been given a promotion, they’ve just returned from a long trip&#8230;</p>

			<h4><span class="accent">❷</span> <b>Listening</b></h4>
			<p id="comments">You’re going to listen to an article about the Free Hugs campaign. Think of three questions to ask about it. Then, listen to the article many times. Did you find the answers to any of your questions? </p>

				<p><span data-start="21976" data-end="29130">The Free Hug Campaign is a social movement that involves offering strangers hugs in public places.</span> <span data-start="29131" data-end="33455">They’re meant to be <a class="new-word" data-word="a random act of kindness" data-type="n" data-en="something nice that you do to someone suddenly and without expecting anything in return">random acts of kindness</a> just to make you feel good.</span> <span data-start="33456" data-end="42814">The person offering the hugs often makes a sign that reads “FREE HUGS”, then holds it up in the street and waits for someone to ask  for a hug.</span></p>
				<p><span data-start="42815" data-end="48362">The campaign was started by Australian <b>Juan Mann*</b> in 2004.</span> <span data-start="48363" data-end="56946">Juan had been living in London for almost a decade when he decided to return to Sydney after his girlfriend <a class="new-word" data-word="to call off" data-type="phr vb" data-en="if you “call off” an event, you cancel it">called off</a> their <a class="new-word" data-word="an engagement" data-type="n" data-en="an agreement between two people to get married">engagement</a>.</span> <span data-start="56947" data-end="60790">On landing, he had nothing but his suitcase.</span></p>
				<p><span data-start="60791" data-end="65414">After about three months, an old friend invited him to a party.</span> <span data-start="65415" data-end="74226">In an interview with WHO magazine, Juan said that while he was at the party, “&#8230;a completely random person <a class="new-word" data-word="to come up to someone" data-type="exp" data-en="to go close to someone so you can talk to them, etc.">came up to me</a> and gave me a hug.</span> <span data-start="74227" data-end="78148">I felt like a king! It was the greatest thing that ever happened.”</span> <span data-start="78149" data-end="80429">Then, he had an idea.</span></p>
				<p><span data-start="80430" data-end="91374">On 30<sup>th</sup> June 2004, Juan made a sign with the words FREE HUGS and offered his first hugs in the centre of the main shopping district in Sydney.</span> <span data-start="91375" data-end="95450">“For the first 15 minutes, people just <a class="new-word" data-word="to stare through" data-type="exp" data-en="if someone “stares through” you, they look ahead as they pass you without even looking at you">stared</a> right <a class="new-word" data-word="to stare through" data-type="exp" data-en="if someone “stares through” you, they look ahead as they pass you without even looking at you">through</a> me.</span> <span data-start="95451" data-end="104137">But then a woman <a class="new-word" data-word="to tap" data-type="vb" data-en="if you “tap” someone on the shoulder, you touch them gently on the shoulder to tell them that you want to speak to them">tapped</a> me on the shoulder and told me she needed a hug as it was the anniversary of the death of a relative,” said Juan.</span> <span data-start="104138" data-end="109733">Things really took off after a FREE HUGS video was <a class="new-word" data-word="to upload" data-type="vb" data-en="to put something onto a website from your computer">uploaded</a> to YouTube.</span> <span data-start="109734" data-end="114480">While in Sydney, Juan met Shimon Moore, an American musician.</span> <span data-start="114481" data-end="117744">Shimon filmed Juan giving away free hugs.</span> <span data-start="117745" data-end="130695">In mid-2006, Juan’s grandmother died, and <a class="new-word" data-word="in consolation" data-type="exp" data-en="if you do something “in consolation”, you do something nice to someone to make them feel happy because they’re sad">in consolation</a> Shimon used the <a class="new-word" data-word="footage" data-type="n" data-en="“footage” of a film is part of it">footage</a> he had shot to make a music video for the song All the Same by his band The Sick Puppies.</span> <span data-start="130696" data-end="136887">The video was later uploaded to YouTube, where it has been viewed over 70 million times.</span></p>
				<p><span data-start="136888" data-end="141823">As a result of the video, the Free Hugs movement became international.</span> <span data-start="141824" data-end="150230">Branches were opened in Taiwan, Italy, America, Switzerland, Norway, India, Portugal and the UK.</span> <span data-start="150231" data-end="154409">Juan was invited to tell his story on the Oprah Winfrey Show.</span> <span data-start="154410" data-end="162142">A website (www.freehugscampaign.org) was launched in mid-2007,</span> <span data-start="162143" data-end="174271">and an annual International Free Hugs Day was set on the first Saturday following 30<sup>th</sup> June as this was the anniversary of the first time that Juan ever offered free hugs in Sydney.</span> <span data-start="174272" data-end="188553">Juan also wrote a book (The Illustrated Guide to Free Hugs), became an after-dinner speaker and published his address and mobile-phone number online, offering to go for a meal with anyone who contacted him.</span></p>
				<p><span data-start="188554" data-end="193470">Off the back of the YouTube video, Shimon and his band got a <a class="new-word" data-word="a record deal" data-type="n" data-en="an agreement with a record company to produce records">record deal</a>,</span> <span data-start="193471" data-end="201800">and they often sold Free Hugs <a class="new-word" data-word="merchandise" data-type="n" data-en="objects such as T-shirts, cups, caps, pens, etc. with the logo, names or colours of a band, film or person on them">merchandise</a> at their concerts such as T-shirts and mugs with Juan’s <a class="new-word" data-word="distinctive" data-type="adj" data-en="if something is “distinctive”, you can notice it easily">distinctive</a> handwriting.</span> <span data-start="201801" data-end="212830">But in an interview Juan gave to a New York-based business news website in 2010, Juan said that all the <a class="new-word" data-word="earnings" data-type="n" data-en="the money you earn or receive">earnings</a> went straight to Shimon and his band members.</span> <span data-start="212831" data-end="220148">“Needless to say,” Juan continued, “we aren’t friends anymore&#8230; I haven't seen a dollar from the band or the manager.”</span></p>
				<p><span data-start="220149" data-end="223586">Perhaps they should give each other a hug!</span> <span class="accent">✪</span></p>
