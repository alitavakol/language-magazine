But in 1857 Indians attacked the British, and for a while, it seemed as if Britain was going to lose her colony.</h3>

				<p>At the time, Britain ruled India through the Honourable East India Company. There was no major competition as the French had been defeated many years before. The company was an independent corporation with its own army, which was even bigger than the regular British Army. Although most of the army’s troops were native Indians, the officers were all British.</p>
				<p>For many years, things were working well; but during the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, there were <a class="new-word" data-word="rumblings of discontent" data-type="exp" data-en="signs that a person or group is becoming unhappy">rumblings of discontent</a>. The British had been in India for about 200 years and their Asian <a class="new-word" data-word="a possession" data-type="n" data-en="something that is owned by someone" data-fa="دارایی">possessions</a> stretched from the Khyber Pass (on the Afghan border) to Burma. Indians were <a class="new-word" data-word="suspicious" data-type="adj" data-en="feeling that something is wrong or that someone is behaving wrongly" data-fa="یک کار یا چیز مشکوک">suspicious</a> of Christian <a class="new-word" data-word="a missionary" data-type="n" data-en="a person sent on a religious mission, especially one sent to promote Christianity in a foreign country" data-fa="مبلّغ مذهبی">missionaries</a> who showed little respect for the ancient culture and traditions of the <a class="new-word" data-word="a subcontinent" data-type="n" data-en="a large, distinguishable part of a continent" data-fa="شبه قاره">subcontinent</a>, and laws <a class="new-word" data-word="concerning" data-type="prep" data-en="relating to, regarding">concerning</a> <a class="new-word" data-word="inheritance" data-type="n" data-en="money, property, etc., that is received from someone when that person dies">inheritance</a> caused anger among the natives. <a class="new-word" data-word="on top of this" data-type="ph" data-en="also">On top of this</a> people started to talk about a <a class="new-word" data-word="a prophecy" data-type="n" data-en="a prediction about the future that is spiritually inspired" data-fa="پیشگویی، غیب‌گویی">prophecy</a>. It said that 100 years after the Battle of Plassey (1757), the rule of the company would come to an end. But how? </p>
				<p>The cause of the <a class="new-word" data-word="rebellion" data-type="n" data-en="organized, and armed resistance to a government or ruler" data-fa="شورش">rebellion</a> was a <a class="new-word" data-word="a rifle" data-type="n" data-en="a gun, especially one fired from shoulder level">rifle</a>. The British soldiers were using the Enfield rifle. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the rifle was modernised so that it could be easily loaded. To help the process the <a class="new-word" data-word="a cartridge" data-type="n" data-en="the metal cylinder on the outside of bullets/ammunition">cartridge</a> was greased with animal fat. Muslim and Hindu <a class="new-word" data-word="a sepoy" data-type="n" data-en="an Indian soldier in the British Army">sepoys</a> were <a class="new-word" data-word="outraged" data-type="adj" data-en="very angry">outraged</a> when they heard that this was a mixture of cow and pig fat as they had to touch the grease. The cow was sacred to the Hindus, and the pig was considered unclean by Muslims. The British realised their mistake, and told the soldiers to use the grease of their choice but the incident had gone too far already. Nobody trusted the <a class="new-word" data-word="a Brit" data-type="abbr" data-en="a person from Britain (short for British)">Brits</a> by now.</p>
				<p><a class="new-word" data-word="the final straw" data-type="exp" data-en="the last thing that can be tolerated before something negative happens">The final straw</a> happened in March 1857 at Barrackpore. A <a class="new-word" data-word="a sepoy" data-type="n" data-en="an Indian soldier in the British Army">sepoy</a> <img src="war.jpg" class="frame" style="float: left; width: 50%; max-width: 5cm; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-right: 8px;"> shot at an officer and then attacked him with a <a class="new-word" data-word="a sword" data-type="n" data-en="A weapon consisting typically of a long, straight or slightly curved, pointed blade having one or two cutting edges and set into a hilt">sword</a>. When the general arrived on the scene, the sepoy tried unsuccessfully to kill himself. He was later <a class="new-word" data-word="to hang" data-type="vb" data-en="kill (someone) by tying a rope attached from above around their neck and removing the support from beneath them">hanged</a> because of the incident. Indian soldiers were <a class="new-word" data-word="embittered" data-type="adj" data-en="annoyed, angry">embittered</a> over the <a class="new-word" data-word="an episode" data-type="n" data-en="a separate part of a serialized work, such as a novel or television series">episode</a> but it was only the beginning.</p>
				<p>In Meerut, 85 soldiers were <a class="new-word" data-word="to be court-martialled" data-type="exp" data-en="to be tried in a military court">court-martialled</a> and sentenced to 10 years <a class="new-word" data-word="hard labour" data-type="n" data-en="a prison sentence where you are forced to work">hard labour</a> for refusing to handle the offending cartridges. To make matters worse, the British <a class="new-word" data-word="publicly" data-type="adv" data-en="in front of a lot people">publicly</a> <a class="new-word" data-word="to humiliate" data-type="vb" data-en="make someone feel ashamed" data-fa="تحقیر کردن">humiliated</a> these soldiers, stripping them of their uniforms and <a class="new-word" data-word="to chain" data-type="vb" data-en="to put chains (lines of metal rings) around someone’s feet and/or arms">chaining</a> them as they took the men to prison. A <a class="new-word" data-word="a riot" data-type="n" data-en="a noisy, violent, and uncontrolled public meeting" data-fa="شورش">riot</a> and local Indians <a class="new-word" data-word="to go on the rampage" data-type="exp" data-en="to become angry and to do things with uncontrolled violence and destruction">went on the rampage</a>, killing any Europeans they could find. The Indians then <a class="new-word" data-word="to flee" data-type="vb" data-en="to run away; to try to escape">fled</a> to Delhi. </p>
				<p>Delhi didn’t have many troops and any British that the rebels found were killed. The local Indian leader, the <a class="new-word" data-word="a Moghul" data-type="n" data-en="a member of the Muslim dynasty that ruled India from 1526 to 1857">Moghul</a> Bahadur Shah, <img src="bahador.jpg" class="frame" style="float: right; width: 60%; max-width: 6cm; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 8px;"> was unwilling to help but took leadership when no British help arrived. The British marched on Delhi, <a class="new-word" data-word="to murder" data-type="vb" data-en="the unlawful killing of another person without excuse" data-fa="به قتل رساندن">murdering</a> anyone <a class="new-word" data-word="disloyal" data-type="adj" data-en="failing to be loyal to a person, country, or organization to which one has obligations" data-fa="بی‌وفا، سست‌پیمان">disloyal</a> on the way and met the rebels outside the city. The British won but they didn’t destroy the resistance, who retreated back to the heavily protected city.</p>
				<p>Soon after, the British organised a column of <a class="new-word" data-word="Sikhs" data-type="n" data-en="an Indian religious group from the Punjab">Sikhs</a> to <a class="new-word" data-word="to march" data-type="vb" data-en="walk in a military manner with a regular measured tread">march</a> against Delhi. They were <a class="new-word" data-word="to reinforce" data-type="vb" data-en="to give more force or effectiveness to something; strengthen">reinforced</a> by <a class="new-word" data-word="a regiment" data-type="n" data-en="a military unit">regiments</a> from the regular British Army who had arrived from the <a class="new-word" data-word="the Crimean War" data-type="n" data-en="a war in which Russia fought Great Britain, France, and Turkey">Crimean War</a>, and the <a class="new-word" data-word="a Gurkha" data-type="n" data-en="a person from Nepal who fights in the British army">Gurkhas</a> had also joined the force. The British eventually took Dehli and arrested the Moghul. Later, an officer, William Hodson, murdered the Moghul's three sons. Hodson, by the way, was the son of a <a class="new-word" data-word="a clergyman" data-type="n" data-en="an official religious minister">clergyman</a>. The Moghul was <a class="new-word" data-word="to spare" data-type="vb" data-en="not to kill; to allow to continue living">spared</a>, but was <a class="new-word" data-word="to send into exile" data-type="exp" data-en="to force someone to live in another country">sent into exile</a> in Rangoon, where he died in 1862.</p>
				<p>The next major confrontation was at Cawnpore. The general in this town <a class="new-word" data-word="naively" data-type="adj" data-en="innocently; not intelligently">naively</a> thought his troops were loyal to him but they <a class="new-word" data-word="to join forces" data-type="exp" data-en="to join with another person or group in order to become stronger">joined forces</a> with an Indian <a class="new-word" data-word="a nobleman" data-type="n" data-en="a lord; an aristocrat">nobleman</a>, Naha Sahib who led them in a <a class="new-word" data-word="a siege" data-type="n" data-en="if there is a “siege”, a city is surrounded by an enemy army">siege</a> of the town <a class="new-word" data-word="a fortress" data-type="n" data-en="a military stronghold" data-fa="قلعه نظامی، دژ">fortress</a>. After many days, and with the British inside the fortress <a class="new-word" data-word="to starve" data-type="vb" data-en="to suffer or die from hunger">starving</a> and thirsty, a <a class="new-word" data-word="to strike a deal" data-type="exp" data-en="to make an agreement">deal was struck</a>: the people inside the fortress could leave. The <a class="new-word" data-word="pathetic" data-type="adj" data-en="arousing pity, especially through vulnerability or sadness" data-fa="احساساتی، سوزناک">pathetic</a> <a class="new-word" data-word="a column" data-type="n" data-en="a long, narrow formation of people">column</a> of British men, women and children left the fortress, but when they got to the river, things went horribly wrong. For some reason, the British opened fire on the Indian boatmen. In return, the rebels also opened fire, then took the women and children <a class="new-word" data-word="a hostage" data-type="n" data-en="if a “hostage” is taken, someone is taken prisoner. This prisoner is often used to negotiate with the enemy">hostage</a>. Later, they were killed in cold blood. This caused an outrage in Britain, and the British responded violently. Naha Sahib escaped, never to be seen again.</p>
				<p>Lucknow was the last major hope of victory for the rebels. The British had <a class="new-word" data-word="to barricade" data-type="vb" data-en="to put barriers in a place so nobody can come or go">barricaded</a> themselves into a <a class="new-word" data-word="a compound" data-type="n" data-en="an enclosed area of land where people can live">compound</a> within the city. The siege, which lasted about five months, was defeated when <a class="new-word" data-word="a Highlander" data-type="n" data-en="a soldier from northern Scotland">Highlanders</a> arrived to help the British residents.  </p>
				<p>In the months that followed, <img src="house.jpg" class="frame" style="float: left; width: 35%; max-width: 4cm; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-right: 8px;"> the British <a class="new-word" data-word="to take back" data-type="phr vb" data-en="to regain possession of">took back</a> what they had lost and went on the rampage across northern India. They killed and <a class="new-word" data-word="to loot" data-type="vb" data-en="to steal, typically during a riot, war, etc">looted</a> entire villages and many British families became rich because of this. This time of attacks became known as “The Devil’s Wind”. Anything the rebels did was repeated many more times by the British.</p>
				<p>As a result of all this, the British government decided to form a government department to rule India. It was too big a colony for a private company, so the India Office was created. Eventually, India won its freedom in 1947 because of the successful independence movement led by the great Mahatma Gandhi. Ironically, the <a class="new-word" data-word="a prophecy" data-type="n" data-en="a prediction about the future that is spiritually inspired" data-fa="پیشگویی، غیب‌گویی">prophecy</a> about the end of the East India Company’s rule came true, even though it was a hundred years later. <span class="accent">✪</span></p>

				<h4>Sacred Cows</h4>
				<p style="margin-top: 8px; font-style: italic;">Hindu groups against the government over a cow.</p>
				<img src="cow.jpg" class="shadow" style="width: 100%;">
				<p>As you know, the cow is sacred for Hindus. It cannot be killed, it cannot be hurt and it certainly cannot be eaten. Just recently, British Hindu groups were concerned over the killing of a cow named Gangotri by the RSPCA (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals). The cow was being kept at the Bhaktivedanta Manor Temple in Hertfordshire, England. On 13<sup>th</sup> December 2007, RSPCA inspectors and a government <a class="new-word" data-word="a prophecy" data-type="n" data-en="a prediction about the future that is spiritually inspired">prophecy</a> arrived at the temple and gave the cow a <a class="new-word" data-word="a vet" data-type="n" data-en="person with a medical degree trained to take care of the health of animals">vet</a> <a class="new-word" data-word="lethal" data-type="adj" data-en="causing death, deadly">lethal</a> <a class="new-word" data-word="injection" data-type="n" data-en="forcing a liquid medicine or drug into someone or something by using a special needle" data-fa="تزریق">injection</a>. The cow had damaged her back legs and could not stand. Hindus were <a class="new-word" data-word="furious" data-type="adj" data-en="extremely angry">furious</a>. The RSPCA claimed that the cow was killed to prevent further suffering. However, Temple officials claim that the cow was being treated by vets, and was being cared for specially. The temple was donated in 1973 by ex-Beatle George Harrison. Staff at the temple run the Cow Protection Project where cows and <a class="new-word" data-word="a bull" data-type="n" data-en="a male bovine, similar to a buffalo" data-fa="یک نوع گاو نر">bulls</a> are allowed to die naturally. <span class="accent">✪</span></p>
