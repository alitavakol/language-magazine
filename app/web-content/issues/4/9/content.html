			<h4><span class="accent">❶</span> <b>Pre-reading</b></h4>

			<div style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 300;">taxi drivers, hotel staff, hairdressers, waiters / waitresses, plumbers / electricians / painters, bar staff, bartenders, railway station porters, pizza delivery people, valets, chauffeurs, your children's teachers, massage therapists, shop assistants, gardeners, lottery ticket sellers, newspaper deliverers, bosses / managers, the doorman/woman, plastic surgeons </div>

			<h4><span class="accent">❷</span> <b>Listening</b></h4>
			<p>How much do you think people tip in other countries? Think. Then, listen to the article to compare your ideas. Listen many times!</p>
			<div class="lockable"><div id="transcript" style="background-size: contain; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: center;">
				<p><span data-start="12320" data-end="16313">How much money do you leave the waiter or waitress in a restaurant?</span> <span data-start="16314" data-end="20565">What about taxi drivers, hotel staff and hairdressers?</span> <span data-start="20566" data-end="25284"><a class="new-word" data-word="to tip" data-type="vb" data-en="to give a waiter / bartender, etc. extra money because you are pleased with the service">Tipping</a> is complex, but even more so when you’re abroad.</span></p> 
				<p><span data-start="25285" data-end="30591">The problem is that every country seems to have its own unofficial “rules”.</span> <span data-start="30592" data-end="39922">In Australia, for example, tipping isn’t common at all, and they aren’t really expected in restaurants&#8230; or anywhere else as a matter of fact.</span> <span data-start="39923" data-end="42912">It’s the same in Iceland and China.</span> <span data-start="42913" data-end="47686">And in Japan, it can actually be considered <a class="new-word" data-word="rude" data-type="adj" data-en="if something is considered “rude”, people don't do it because it is disrespectful / not nice, etc.">rude</a> to tip in a restaurant.</span> <span data-start="47687" data-end="53622">In fact, if you leave money a waiter might even chase you to give it back.</span> <span data-start="53623" data-end="60593">In most of Europe, tipping a waiter is fairly common. However, amounts vary from country to country.</span> <span data-start="60594" data-end="65417">In England, for example, most people tip around 10% of the bill.</span> <span data-start="65418" data-end="70190">But in Spain people generally only leave <a class="new-word" data-word="small change" data-type="n" data-en="coins (metal pieces of money) of little value: 5 cents, 10 cents, etc.">small change</a>.</span></p>
				<p><span data-start="70191" data-end="77150">However, if there’s one country where you really should tip, it’s the United States.</span> <span data-start="77151" data-end="83804"><a class="new-word" data-word="in stark contrast to" data-type="exp" data-en="very different from">In stark contrast to</a> Japan, a waiter will probably chase you down the street if you don't leave a tip!</span> <span data-start="83805" data-end="90321">Not only that, but Americans usually tip up to a <a class="new-word" data-word="hefty" data-type="adj" data-en="very big">hefty</a> 20% in restaurants.</span> <span data-start="90322" data-end="96928">So, if you’re saving up for a big dinner in the US, make sure you take that into account.</span> <span data-start="96929" data-end="99849">Americans also tip for drinks.</span> <span data-start="99850" data-end="108502">In fact, there are some bars in New York where staff earn such big money from tips that they receive no wages.</span> <span data-start="108503" data-end="111990">Some people even pay to work there!</span></p> 
				<p><span data-start="111991" data-end="116900">But it isn’t only in bars and restaurants where you’re supposed to tip.</span> <span data-start="116901" data-end="122370">Here’s some advice from a travel website on how you should tip in an American hotel:</span> <span data-start="122371" data-end="133357">$3 for the <a class="new-word" data-word="a parking attendant" data-type="n" data-en="a person who parks your car for you when you go to a restaurant or hotel">parking attendant</a>, $2 for the doorperson if they <a class="new-word" data-word="to hail a taxi" data-type="exp" data-en="to raise your arm in order to let a taxi driver know that you need a taxi">hail a taxi</a> for you, and $1 for each bag they help you with.</span> <span data-start="133358" data-end="140731">The <a class="new-word" data-word="a bellhop" data-type="n" data-en="a person who helps you carry your bags to your hotel room">bellhop</a> gets $2 per bag, and you should leave the <a class="new-word" data-word="a maid" data-type="n" data-en="a person who cleans the rooms in a house or hotel">maids</a> $3 to $5 a day.</span> <span data-start="140732" data-end="148183">So, for two people for one weekend that’s about $20 before you’ve even paid for the room.</span></p> 
				<p><span data-start="148184" data-end="151042">But why is there so much tipping?</span> <span data-start="151043" data-end="159197">Well, in many cases, workers are paid below the minimum wage as they’re expected to make up the difference with tips.</span> <span data-start="159198" data-end="167033">As a result, a <a class="new-word" data-word="a server" data-type="n" data-en="a waiter; a person who brings your food at a restaurant">server</a> could earn a decent wage on a good night, or hardly <a class="new-word" data-word="to break even" data-type="phr vb" data-en="if you have “broken even”, you have spent as much money as you have earned">break even</a> on a <a class="new-word" data-word="a slow night" data-type="n" data-en="if a restaurant has a “slow night”, there aren’t many customers">slow night</a>.</span> <span data-start="167034" data-end="179020">Service sector workers are even expected to pay <a class="new-word" data-word="income tax" data-type="n" data-en="money you pay to the government based on a percentage of the money you make. The tax is used to pay for hospitals, the police, etc.">income tax</a> on the tips as they’re considered part of their normal wages for the job they do – not just “extra” money.</span></p>
				<p><span data-start="179021" data-end="184400">So, as you can see, tipping in the US is serious business.</span> <span data-start="184401" data-end="187777">There’s even a website for celebrity tippers.</span> <span data-start="187778" data-end="197339">Stained Apron (www.stainedapron.com) has information on who’s who in the world of tipping.</span> <span data-start="197340" data-end="202904">Under the column heading “<a class="new-word" data-word="scum" data-type="n inform" data-en="bad people; not very nice people">Scum</a>”, you can find a list of the bad tippers.</span> <span data-start="202905" data-end="207993">Those on the list include Al Gore, Dan Quayle and Bridget Fonda.</span> <span data-start="207994" data-end="217250">And under “<a class="new-word" data-word="a saint" data-type="n" data-en="a very nice person">Saints</a>” there’s a list of the generous tippers, which includes Johnny Depp, Ray Charles, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton.</span> <span data-start="217251" data-end="222912">But could anyone possibly match the late Kerry Packer (the Australian billionaire)?</span> <span data-start="222913" data-end="231020">He was always a generous tipper, but on one occasion he casually asked the waitress serving him how big her <a class="new-word" data-word="a mortgage" data-type="n" data-en="money you borrow from the bank in order to buy a house">mortgage</a> was.</span> <span data-start="231021" data-end="234650">The tip he left her <a class="new-word" data-word="to pay off" data-type="phr vb" data-en="if you “pay off” your mortgage, you return all the money you have borrowed">paid it off</a> to the last penny.</span> <span data-start="234651" data-end="238343">Now that really is “saintly tipping”!</span></p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span data-start="238344" data-end="243372">Of course, make sure you’re a billionaire before trying that one!</span> <span class="accent">✪</span></p>
